**Project:** https://github.com/gnoverse/kontribz

### Project summary

Kontribz is a fully decentralized, platform dedicated to collaboration and tasks/bounties management.

It enables organizations to create and manage bounties or tasks, while offering contributors the opportunity to complete them and earn rewards. The entire process is conducted with complete transparency, featuring real-time progress tracking and an integrated rating system for contributors and organizations. Each participant also benefits from a detailed and evolving profile that reflects their contributions and reputation over time.

### Goals and deliverables

### Impact on gno.land’s developer ecosystem
Kontribz will significantly accelerate Gno.land's developer ecosystem growth by solving the coordination problem in decentralized development. By providing a transparent, on-chain platform for task management and bounties, it creates a clear pathway for developers to discover opportunities, contribute meaningfully, and earn rewards—all while building verifiable on-chain reputations.

**Long-term Commitment:** Kontribz is not a one-off dApp—we're building a sustainable startup with a long-term vision. Beyond development, we're committed to active marketing and community growth efforts, which will directly increase Gno.land's visibility in the broader blockchain and developer communities. As Kontribz gains traction and users, it serves as a gateway introducing new developers and organizations to the Gno.land ecosystem, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and adoption.

### Why are you and your team well-suited for this project?
Our team combines  Gno.land experience with genuine user perspective. We've already successfully received and completed a previous grant from Gno.land, giving us hands-on expertise with Gnolang and the ecosystem's architecture.

More importantly, we are ourselves active bounty hunters and contributors in the open-source space. We're building the platform we need—not just a theoretical solution. This dual role as both builders and users ensures we understand the real pain points and will remain committed to Kontribz's success long-term.
We're not creating a disposable dApp—we're building a sustainable startup with ongoing development, marketing, and community support beyond this grant period.
